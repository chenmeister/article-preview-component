## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To leverage JavaScript for setting the `.active` class to display the social media tooltips. 

### Continued development

I plan on refining this project more by having the social media tooltip to display above the share icon when clicked. I am having some trouble getting it to display properly. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
